### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi, Iâ€™m brahman45.

```
Google treats a hyphen as a word separator, but does not treat an underscore that way.
Google treats and underscore as a word joiner â€” so red_sneakers is the same as redsneakers to Google.
```
Iâ€™m aware of the above and give the file name, but knitr and R Markdown users should only use hyphens.

The newer repositories are worth reading. But of course, this is often not the case. This is because 90% of repositories are not put there for an unspecified number of people to see. Only â€˜triangleLibraryâ€™ in cpp is put for unspecified number of people to see.

Top languages does not indicate my skill level or something like that, itâ€™s a github metric of which languages I have the most code on github.

I learned the below
```
arduino, FUSION360, Machine Learning, Electronics, C/C++, C#, game creation, php, bot creation, drone programming, competitive programming,
assembly, verilog, GAS, GCP, image processing, python, golang, html, css, javascript and more
```
but, I donâ€™t put all of them on github.
