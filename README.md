### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

```
Google treats a hyphen as a word separator, but does not treat an underscore that way.
Google treats and underscore as a word joiner â€” so red_sneakers is the same as redsneakers to Google.
```
I take care of the above and give the file name, but knitr and R Markdown users should only use hyphens.

The newer repositories are worth reading. But of course, this is often not the case. This is because 90% of repositories are not put there for an unspecified number of people to see.

NOTE: Top languages does not indicate my skill level or something like that, it's a github metric of which languages I have the most code on github.
